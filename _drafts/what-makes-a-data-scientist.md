So much ink has been spilled on "what is data science" you might be wondering why we need more.

Never mind, I've done this before (link to What is Analytics? orange paper)

There's of course the canoncial diagram by Drew Conway, and its many derivatives.

Recently discussed with Daniel Hulme, CEO of Satalia, about hiring data scientists.

Struggled to put in to words the intangible thing that isn't on these diagrams of overlapping skills and techniques.

In my own journey, I had the benefit of being deprogrammed from less robust ways of learning about the world. Use to just make a "strong argument supported by facts", then realised this is actually weak. If you just mature to "everything depends" you actually know less. Need to both realise everything depends on everything else, and learn ways to sort out what depends on what, and by how much.

This cumulative process has a name: science. In that sense, "data science" is well-named, but the methodology underlying science is not often clear in training.

Curiousity -> Systematic Curiousity (i.e. backed by tools and process)

New questions + persistence to doubt them at the same time as examining them

Ironically, disciplines where scientific method more ingrained (e.g. physics) might have a harder time imparting this "wrestling" on students, because it is taken as given that this is how you do things. In disciplines where scientific method less ingrained (e.g. political science), wrestling with how to implement the scientific method is part of the job.
