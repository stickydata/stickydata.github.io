When I was a consultant my bosses, both directors of the company and its chief salespeople, came to me often with ideas they had for data science projects: 'company X, which sells product Y, wants to do some predictive analytics to understand Z'.

They soon got used to my first two questions:
1. Do they have the data?
2. Will they make the data available?

You would be surprised how many times company X answers both questions with 'no'.

Here's a secret: the actual high-powered fancy-algorithms jargon-filled part of data science is pretty straightforward for most prediction problems.[^1]

Two things: getting hold of the data, integrating the data

Second hardest thing is getting the data. Hardest thing is 'wrangling', the complex, far-too-artisanal-for-by-liking process by which raw data becomes ready for prediction.

A problem in the practice of any individual analyst, and in teams, and at the level of whole industry

[^1] Obviously there are many prediction problems that are incredibly gnarly, and this final part of the technical process is indeed more difficult than getting the data ready. These cases are on the leading edge: the majority of prediction problems are analytically simple.
