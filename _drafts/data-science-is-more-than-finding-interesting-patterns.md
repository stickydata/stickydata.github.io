These patterns must be unexpected to generate completely new knowledge. 

If we make a graph that looks cool, but shows what we already expected, there is value. Often in business we are trying to understand why something doesn't work, which requires a minimal theory of what 'should' be happening in order to shed light on what is anomalous.

Reference Kuhn: two types of discoveries, expected vs unexpected

Risks are subtly different. When expected (ie filling in periodic table) we are too eager to accept what fits the neat box. When unexpected (ie WTF is oxygen?) risk is we dismiss anomalies that could lead to meaningful re-evaluation of what we think we know. Can help ourselves by recognising these biases and using a little of each in the other case: to treat confirmation of what we expected as potential unexpected anomaly and dismiss easy confirmation more easily; to treat anomalies when looking to confirm what we expected as potential confirmation of some alternative explanation and not just 'burps' from the data.
