<div class="blurb">
	<h1>I am Shaun McGirr, and StickyData is the name of my (future) consulting business.</h1>
	<p>It doesn’t exist yet. There’s no concrete timeline, but I do know what success looks like: when people who want to achieve remarkable things with data come to me for advice, and I make it happen.</p>	
	<p>To that end, this site collects my <a href="/blog">thinking, writing and doing</a>, and the best of what I find elsewhere.</p>
	<p>If you want to know the one best machine-learning algorithm for all cases, you may not be my target audience.</p>
	<p>Here are some things I care about and strive for, to help you decide: transparency, credibility, repeatability, obsolescence.</p>
